# 3D Stock Volatility Surface

Plots specified stock symbol's volatility surface in 3D, plotting implied volatility on the z-axis and days-to-expiration and strike price on the X and Y axes.  Allows for user rotation.

Includes basic PyQt5 GUI to specify stock symbol.  Also includes save capability.

Requires data from database (so does not fully function as-is).

Created according to spec for summer 2017 internship at Bell Curve Capital.
